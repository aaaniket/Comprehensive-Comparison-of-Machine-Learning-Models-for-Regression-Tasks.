# Comprehensive Comparison of Machine Learning Models for Regression Tasks.

## Description:

Welcome to my GitHub repository dedicated to the comprehensive comparison of machine learning models tailored specifically for regression tasks. Here, we provide a detailed exploration of various regression algorithms, enabling users to select the most suitable model for their predictive analytics needs.

Diverse Model Selection: Our repository covers a wide array of regression models, including Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, and Gradient Boosting Regressor, among others. Each model offers unique strengths and capabilities, allowing users to explore different approaches to regression analysis.

Data Preprocessing: We emphasize the importance of data preprocessing in ensuring the quality and integrity of the dataset. Our code includes steps to address missing values, remove duplicates, and correct errors, laying the foundation for robust model training and evaluation.

Model Training and Evaluation: We provide detailed scripts for training each selected model using the training data and evaluating its performance on the test set. Evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared (RÂ²) are computed to assess prediction accuracy and model fit.

Model Comparison: The heart of our repository lies in the comparative analysis of model performance. By comparing multiple machine learning models on the same dataset, users gain insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm, empowering them to make informed decisions in model selection.
